        <p>Inspired by the novel <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i> by Laura Esquivel. 
        Tita De La Garza is in love with Pedro, but family tradition forbids her to marry, but instead care for her mother until she dies. 
        Tita struggles for freedom, independence and self expression through her cooking.
        </p>

        <p>You will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>8oz of Sweet Cream</li>
            <li>8oz of Oat Milk</li>
            <li>4 bold dashes of Cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 bold dashes of Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Mocha sauce for layering</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>This drink is in the proportions of an iced venti/large (20oz). The drink can easily be adjusted 
            to any size or even hot if you just let the barista know "half oatmilk and half sweet cream". Remember the sweet cream is a made in house 
            special blend so it will come sweet and is different than asking for just "cream". Despite the name the drink does have dairy in it. 
            For those who are lactose sensitive this drink does have lactose but is considered relatively low compared to standard glass of milk. 
            The drink is beautifully more aromatice when hot and no propotions need to be adjusted. When going to a grande/medium the 
            amount of dashes of each spice could be kept the same or halved; dealer's choice. If asking for a tall/small ask for half the amount of dashes.</p>

        <p>For the Barista:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Refresher Shaker mix sweet cream upwards to the base and oatmilk to the juice/water line.</li>
            <li>throw in the dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg <b>before</b> you fill shaker with ice</li>
            <li>shake it like you don't get paid enough to make crazy drinks and pour</li>
            <li>if you dont have a mocha sauce bottle you can do one pump of mocha in an espresso shot glass and layer it on the ice</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>*If the customer asks for a shot of espresso I would actually mix it in the shot glass with the mocha and layer</p>

        <h3>What I would do differently</h3>

            <p>One of the great things about Starbucks Cafe options is all the customizations and color you can add to your drink to make 
                it as weird or unique as you. Who am I to say you can't make this a frappe and blend it with a cake pop? So what I would 
                do differently would merely reflect the homage to the book this drink is based off of while making it a balanced drink hold 
                that integrity, even if that means sarificing personal prefrences. For example I LOVE CARAMEL, and caramel syrup and caramel 
                drizzle in this oatchata would be amazing. But this section to be as much of a drinkmonger snob crafting a drink that represent 
                this book with the ingrediants you would find at a starbucks cafe.</p>
    
            <p>Staying in the cafe; the sweet cream is sweet enough as is but whole milk can be subsituted if it is too sweet. If it is not sweet 
                enough, I reccomened asking if they have liquid cane sugar. If not classic is fine, one or two pumps, just to still have that flavor 
                of spices and cream to still hold weight. Yes brown sugar could be used instead, but brown sugar, cinnamon and chocolate together would 
                suggest too much in the mind that this is a desert drink. There is nothing wrong with a desert drink, but chocolate and cinnamon are seen 
                as just desert fuel in the United States. In other countries the two are used in savory dishes as well. Chocolate is known as a savory 
                topping sauce in a lot of Mexican cuisine and Cinnamon is a floral note used in stews. Wanting to invite the idea of experience chocolate 
                and cinnamon as a sweet and savory dish is why I want the drink to be subtly sweet. Brown sugar, vanilla or even caramel (sigh) would be great 
                but it isn't what Tita from the book would do. If you really wanna be woke you can ask the barista to mix the cinnamon and mocha together since 
                cinnamon is in Mexican Chocolate.</p>
    
            <p>If I were at home making this drink to impress fans of the book, there is a lot more theatre I would add to the drink. First I would just 
                make real horchata which kinda ruins this whole premise. And If I gave a horchata recipe here it would really undo this whole thing so lets 
                just stick to oatmilk and pretend your book club friends are really against rice milk. That's fine too, <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i> 
                doesn't have any drink recipees, so you can make Tita proud by following the recipees of the foodstuffs. Now back to the drink, I would ground 
                a little bit or star anise and clove for a subtle taste to the oatchata. I would get red rose petals and grind them and use them to rim wine 
                glasses to pour your oatchata in. Once read to serve I would have water simmering on the stove and mix it with mexican chocolate.</p>
            
            <p>If you do not have Mexican Chocoalte you can make a quick crude one with</p>
            <ul>
                <li>water</li> 
                <li>dark chocolate</li>
                <li>cinnamon</li>
                <li>sugar(less is more)</li></ul>
            
            <p>It doesn't have to be thick but it shouldn't be too runny either. Don't overthink it, its just a boogie layer for a boogie drink. 
                I would layer that on the oatchata and toss a little bit of crushed almonds in the center, jus enough for garnish, we. The star anise, 
                clove, rose petals and almonds refrence slightly her other dishes and these ingrediants are versitle in both sweet or savory dishes. Wow, 
                if you pulled this off, I'll marry you if Pedro won't (it will have to be an open marriage though).</p>

        <h2>The Headless Horseman</h2>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>Don't loose your head reading this!</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This drink is inspired by the titular character of the same name from Washington Irving's <i> The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>. A restless and 
            headless ghost, wielding a jack-o-lantern, haunts a small town looking for his lost head. Ichabod Crane, the town's schoolmaster, tries to court a Katrina Van Tassel when 
            his luck is tested when he comes across the desperate spirit.</p>

        <p>You will need:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>8oz of milk</li>
            <li>mocha sauce</li>
            <li>pumpkin sauce</li>
            <li>2oz of skim milk</li>
            <li>3 shots of espresso</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This drink is in the proportions of an iced venti/large (20oz). It is basically a chocolate milk with pumpkin cold foam with upside down esspresso shots.
            The Headless Horseman is served in a glass with the last inch of the cup filled with the pumpkin foam. The foam is <b>NOT</b> sweet cream foam, we want the 
            top of the drink to be very airy and light on purpose to imitate being headless. The espresso is best dark and starndard to resemble a bitter darkness left
            behind. The cup is covered with a frappe lid instead of the standard drink lid and <b>is not topped with anything</b>. The point is the drink should 
            look like it is missing a head.</p>

        
        <p>For the Barista:
            <br>This is basically chocolate milk with pumpkin cold foam and upside down shots</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Make a light ice iced chocolate milk with the 8oz and mocha sauce.</li>
            <li>top with pumpkin cold foam made with skim milk and pumpkin sauce.</li>
            <li>pour in espresso shots in the middle and top with frappe dome lid. Do not fill in the lid, so to keep the appearance of a headless spirit</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>

    <p>Doing this at home I would recreate this by blending milk, light ice (enough so it's icy but not so it becomes a frappe) and dark chocolate. You would
        need to know how to create or buy your own pumpkin sauce. Elsewhere on the site you can find those kinds of recipees. Use a milk with as little or no fat content
        to foam very airy to keep with the weightless headless illusion, especially since you might not have a dome lid at home. I would take the back of a spoon
        and make an indent on the foam in the middle to continue the headless theme. In that indent precisely pour the espresso.</p>
