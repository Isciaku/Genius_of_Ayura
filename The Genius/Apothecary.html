    <h3>Sadie Hawkins</h3><p>One of the Classic Tripple Threats</p>

    <p>The Tripple Threats, as I called them during my early mixologist days, were my first completed finest projects. 
        Basically, I wanted to come up with three drinks that represented different levels of sweetness, amber, tang, 
        and flavor but had to meet three requirements.</p>
        <ul><li>They had to get me very very drunk</li>
            <li>They had to cost as cheap as possible for a mixed drink</li>
            <li>They had to be simple to make but still impressive when I showed them off on dates</li></ul>
    
    <p>I got a lot of gay jokes with this one. Lol. But this was because there was, and still are, a lot of people who 
        think a drink has to taste disgusting for it to get you drunk. I was getting drunker at a better cost per serving 
        with a waaaaay tastier drink. The Sadie Hawkins was my first of the three drinks I created and its sweet sour and 
        subtle savory notes makes it a wild treat. And yes, it is pink.</p>

        <p>You will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1oz of Amaretto</li>
            <li>1oz of Vanilla Vodka</li>
            <li>8oz of Sour Mix</li>
            <li>Grenadine</li>
            <li>A Cherry and/or Lime for garnish</li></ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Pour Amaretto and Vanilla Vodka into Highball glass with ice</li>
            <li>Drop in the sour mix and splash of grenadine and stir</li>
            <li>add cherry and lime for garnish</li></ol>

        <p>Kinda straightforward. Don't worry there will be impossible drinks, I just need to build your confidence up first. 
            Because this drink is a delightly and gentle sweet and sour you get a nice different boquet and taste experience if you opt 
            to have a few cherries as the garnish or a few limes instead. I like to have one of each so I can go back and forth between the 
            sweetness and the sourness of the drink.</p>

    <h4>What I would do differently</h4>

        <p>Making this at home the only thing you could really do to impress beyond the simply ingrediants is by using homemade sourmix instead of 
            the syrup water mix they have at bars. To really "girly" up the theme you could also add edible glitter and finish with almond bitters 
            to bring out the subtle nutty notes. And don't be afraid with adding extra cherries or limes.</p>

    <p> This drink is suppose to be in honor of the Donkey Kong Arcade game. So to represent the Kongs we need both coconuts and bananas like 
        the fruits they collect. Banana tends to have a stronger taste so thats why we have a little less of it but of course adjust to taste if you want. 
        Chocolate syrup used actually shouldnt be too sweet. Were not going for Willy Wonker but a slight completary note that doesn't steal the show from the 
        jungle fruits. When choosing between coconut  milks or milk for the drink, keep in mind dairy is a bit more thicker so might need a higher adjustment 
        of other ingrediants to go through. </p>

        <p>You will need:</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 oz Coconut Rum</li>
            <li>0.5 oz Banana Liquor</li>
            <li>8oz Milk or Coconut Milk</li>
            <li>Chocolate Syrup</li>
            <li>A Fruit by the Foot</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li> in a shaker mix the coconut rum and banana liquor with the milk, pour into 12 oz highball glass filled with ice, strain out milk foam.</li>
            <li>stir in enough chocolate syrup for a light to medium tan brown complection.</li>
            <li>take a roll of fruit by the foot and wrap it around in the fashion of a tie around the collar of the glass.</li>
            <li>beat your chest, throw a barrell, and serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>What I would do differently</h4>

            <p>All these drinks' recipees are written for the patron to order at the bar, with the mindset of what a typical bar would have. 
                The porportions are a little biased on behalf of the bar owner to be honest. Since I am writing these down for my own future bar 
                plans as well as possible partnerships, to market myself appropriately I need to write these recipees on what most bars could carry, 
                typically bar stock, as well as cost.</p>

            <p>With that said, a bar would typically have a larger stock of coconut rum than banana liquor. That said, I still stand by my arguement there
                 should be more coconut rum than banana liquor. And while not every bar will have coconut milk, enough of them would have milk. Now if you were 
                 making this at home to impress someone, instead of chocolate syrup try blending a handful of cocopuffs. The chocolate and cereal milk taste
                  reall pulls a better nostalgia feel into the drink. Also don't feel wasteful if you have to cut down the fruit by the foot so it looks more 
                  like a professional tie. if you have a glass mug to serve your drink in, the better. A mug gives more of a barrel illusion than the highball.</p>
