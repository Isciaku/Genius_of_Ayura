    <h1> The Genius of Ayura</h1>

        <p>Welcome to me trying to learn how to code/website build while trying to show off how cool I am and build my thoughts. This actually isn't my first document, but I am hoping this is my last "first" one trying to build. The main focus of this, if you were invited, is for me to learn and play with specifically list building, linking, images and css. SO DON'T BE MEAN!!! My "other" documents-not yet a website-is where im trying the other stuff....by being mean to my friends lol. Okay I think this is enough baggage to prove to myself I know how to use the p tag. Cheers!</p>
